					<p>While it's true he's been in the game for over two decades and has a client list that reads like the Fortune 100, what most don't know is that he's played bass guitar with Sly Stone, Jimmy Buffet, and Robbie Krieger of The Doors. Rumor has it, he used to wear bell bottoms, butterfly collars, and Old Spice cologne, and danced with wild abandon for Dick Clark on American Bandstand. Music taught Cliff how to tell stories with sound; jazz taught him how to imagine, envision, improvise and make cool stuff out of nothing but a notion.</p>

					<p>Our Sherpa, our pilot, our keeper of flame, Cheryl's spent more time than she'd like to admit helping corporations, NGO's, charities, and small businesses communicate to their constituents. Insightful, inspirational, indefatigable, she is the cultivator of two twenty-somethings, one tween, one teen, two dogs, her husband Cliff, vegetable and flower gardens, and an assortment of wayward humanity. Two things you should avoid doing with Cheryl: underestimate her ability to navigate absolutely any terrain, and eat fast food if she's anywhere in the vicinity.</p>

					<p>Todd's a true editing talent, post-production pro, and operations guru. Award winning work for clients like Showtime and HBO, MTV and VH1, USA and Discovery, landed him at the helm of Mindsmack TV, M Creative's east-coast cousin in the heart of Manhattan. An extraordinarily resourceful media maven, Todd's never met a project he couldn't get passionate about and often gets visibly sweaty when discussing the Internet and the all the possibilities the medium presents.

That might be enough to do in a day for any ordinary mortal, but not “Big Boy Booyah” Bailey. He's also an accomplished fashion photographer, knows more about 3D than James Cameron (almost), and hosts tasting parties for those deep fried tacos they serve at Jack in the Box.</p>

He's got talent that transforms work on both sides of the camera, and, despite being Canadian, Michael often voices his opinion with conviction, and will fight back if he's forced to.</p>
