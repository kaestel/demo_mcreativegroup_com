					<h2>The C Word</h2>
					<p>So why is everybody talking about the cloud like it’s the second coming of the Internet? Well, because it is.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, <span class="bold">cloud computing</span> is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product. So you get all kinds of computing functionality, most commonly delivered through application program interfaces (APIs), without having to buy hardware and/or software capable of performing all those functions. The actual term <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJncFirhjPg" target="_blank">“cloud”</a> is just a metaphor for the Internet, really just a word marketers have used to make the notion sound sexy.</p>

						<p>Speaking of sexy, Google, facebook, Amazon, and Apple lead the way in cloud computing services with infrastructures that are actually used by other companies to offer their own cloud services. With more and more companies packaging the so-called cloud, your Internet connection is a ticket to all kinds of computing power you didn’t have before the cloud came along. In the wise, wonderful words of a woman at an airport in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lel3swo4RMc" target="_blank">Windows 7 ad</a>, “Yay cloud.”</p>

					<h2>Who moved us in 2011</h2>
					<p>From the launch of a product to the introduction of a service solution, so much of the <a href="/work">media we make at M</a> is about what’s new, what’s now, and what’s next. At the start of our 16th planetary orbit, it seemed fitting to us to mark the passage of time with a little look back at the year we left behind. Here are five personalities we think made the year especially memorable.</p>

					<p><span class="italic">The</span> <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/10/jobs/all/1" target="_blank">global icon for innovation</a>, <span class="bold">Steve Jobs</span> left the realm this year. In his passing, he’s become a global brand in his own right, more widely known and admired now than ever before.</p>

					<p>On September 22, 2011 <span class="bold">Meg Whitman</span> took over as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Whitman" target="_blank">new president and CEO of HP</a>. Do you ever wonder what it must be like to pilot a 120 billion dollar business? We do.</p>

					<p> <span class="bold">Wilmot Reed Hastings</span> isn’t quite a household name yet but we expect him to be before long. The co-founder of Netflix, Hastings and the company he made continue to challenge the media conglomerate status quo. Not bad for a guy named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Hastings" target="_blank">Wilmot</a>.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Seth Godin</span> continues to be as prolific as ever. He published two books in ’11, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IapqgokfNU" class="italic" target="_blank">Poke The Box</a>, and <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/we-are-all-weird.html" class="italic" target="_blank">We Are All Weird</a>. We like the way Seth thinks and writes so we definitely recommend his books and his blog. Interesting that the word God is in his last name.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Brian Griffin</span> is a truly remarkable dog. Not only can he walk (upright) and talk (intelligently), in 2011 he went toe-to-toe with Arianna Huffington on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNbpSv4-4Is" class="italic" target="_blank">Real Time with Bill Maher</a>. What can your dog do?</p>

					<h2>The making of M</h2>
					<p>15 years ago we started a video production company called Millennium Creative Group. Today, we have evolved into M, a full-service creative agency dedicated to making and moving media content. We’d be lying if we told you this process of reevaluation, redefinition, and repositioning has been easy. It hasn’t. It’s taken a ton of reflection, days of discussions, hour upon hour of analysis and self-examination. Who are we? Who do we want to be? What do we stand for? What do we bring to the game that sets us apart? What do we believe in?</p>

					<p>The answers to those questions lie before you now in our new website. It embodies our conviction that simplicity, clarity, and clean design are the most powerful tools in marketing today. It speaks to our belief that flash and hyperbole have no place in a media landscape characterized by clutter and constant noise. In the sum of its parts, it is a testament to the idea that the best way a business can send a message is to <span class="italicbold">be</span> the message.</p>

					<p>While it’s a work in progress and will be sharpened, polished and perfected in the days and months ahead, it’s a solid start and showcases our passion for partnering 
					with brands and businesses to tell stories that inform, entertain, and inspire.</p>
